<!--
IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ BEFORE SUBMITTING A USER AGENT ISSUE

Browscap is an open source database of user agents (UAs), and does not have a team of people to add your user agent suggestion. Reporting this issue does not mean the UA will automatically get added.

The best way to get your UA issue report added/updated is to submit a pull request yourself! Please read: https://github.com/browscap/browscap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md for help on that.
